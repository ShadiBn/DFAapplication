# DFA Applicatin

DFA Application is an interactive Java Swing application designed to facilitate the exploration and manipulation of Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs). This tool is ideal for students, educators, or anyone interested in experimenting with formal language theory concepts.

## Key Features

- **DFA Definition:**
    - Input valid symbols, states, starting state, and final states.
    - Define transitions between states based on input symbols.

- **DFA Operations:**
  - Compare the equivalence of two DFAs.
  - Optimize the DFA by minimizing its transitions.
  - Verify whether a given string is accepted by the DFA.
  - Automatically generate strings accepted by the DFA.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dfa-playground.git

2. **Compile and Run Home.java**

# How to Use the app

1. ## Define Your DFA:

- Input valid symbols, states, starting state, and final states.
- Effortlessly set up transitions between states by clicking a few buttons.

2. ## Perform Operations:

- **Check Equivalence:**
  - Explore whether two DFAs are equivalent.
- **Minimize DFA:**
  - Optimize your DFA by minimizing transitions.
- **Validate Strings:**
  - Test a string to see if it's accepted by the DFA.
- **Generate Strings:**
  - Automatically generate strings that the DFA accepts.
- **Visualize Transitions:**
  -Dynamic representation of DFA transitions for better understanding.
